# DECtalk synthesizer driver for NVDA.
#
# The NVDA sibling of the DECtalk Apple/Android projects: drives the classic
# DECtalk formant engine (built from dectalk/dectalk as a native x64/x86
# DECtalk.dll) through its in-memory TTS API, and exposes the same parameter
# surface as the mobile apps — global rate/volume/SPF/pauses plus all 28
# per-voice [:dv] parameters, persisted per voice.
#
# Architecture: speak() converts NVDA's speech sequence into DECtalk inline
# command text with [:index mark N] marks and queues it for a worker thread.
# The worker runs the blocking in-memory synthesis; PCM buffers are fed to an
# nvwave.WavePlayer whose backpressure paces the engine, and index marks are
# attached to the PCM slice they fall in via feed(onDone=...).
